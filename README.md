# projects_for_study

Training projects are stored in this repository.
At the moment they have two sources:

1. They're completed as a result of passing the DataQuest course.
2. They're based on my life datasets (like books from my library, Untappd/Wikipedia/Kinopoisk profiles).

As you can guess, all data has three sources:
1. Using in Dataquest portal.
2. Collected by me.
3. Generated in apps.


Thanks for attention!
